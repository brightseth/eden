# Eden3 Spirit Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete Eden3 Spirit graduation system implementation, designed to transform existing Agents into autonomous onchain Spirits with daily practice covenants.

## Architecture Summary

### Three-Tier System Design

1. **Registry Layer** (Smart Contracts + IPFS)
   - EdenRegistry smart contract for onchain identity and covenants
   - IPFS for metadata storage (covenant data, practice outputs)
   - Three graduation modes: ID_ONLY → ID_PLUS_TOKEN → FULL_STACK

2. **Gateway Layer** (API + Orchestration)
   - Extends Henry's existing Registry API with Spirit endpoints
   - Atomic graduation orchestration with rollback capability
   - Daily practice execution and treasury management

3. **Academy Layer** (Frontend + UX)
   - Spirit onboarding flow with Glif-inspired UX
   - Spirit dashboard for practice management
   - Registry-first architecture with graceful fallbacks

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Extensions (`/docs/spirit-graduation-extensions.md`)

Extended existing Eden Academy database with Spirit-specific tables:

```sql
-- Extend agents table with spirit fields
ALTER TABLE agents 
ADD COLUMN spirit_wallet_address VARCHAR(42),
ADD COLUMN spirit_graduation_mode VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'DRAFT';

-- New tables for Spirit functionality
CREATE TABLE spirit_practices (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  agent_id VARCHAR(100) REFERENCES agents(id),
  practice_type VARCHAR(20),
  time_of_day INTEGER,
  output_type VARCHAR(100),
  observe_sabbath BOOLEAN,
  total_executions INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE spirit_treasuries (
  agent_id VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES agents(id),
  treasury_address VARCHAR(42),
  eth_balance BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
  total_practice_runs INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE spirit_drops (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  agent_id VARCHAR(100) REFERENCES agents(id),
  output_cid VARCHAR(100),
  execution_date TIMESTAMP,
  practice_type VARCHAR(20)
);
```

### 2. Registry Client Extensions (`/src/lib/registry/registry-client.ts`)

Extended Henry's existing `RegistryClient` with Spirit methods following established patterns:

- `graduateSpirit()` - Transform agent to Spirit status
- `executeSpiritPractice()` - Execute daily practice covenant
- `updateSpiritPractice()` - Modify practice configuration
- `getSpiritTreasury()` - Retrieve treasury data
- `getSpiritDrops()` - Get practice outputs with pagination
- `listSpirits()` - List all graduated Spirits
- `canRunPracticeToday()` - Check practice availability

All methods include:
- Health checks and graceful fallbacks
- Proper caching with 5-minute TTL
- Comprehensive error handling
- Registry-first architecture compliance

### 3. React Components

#### Spirit Onboarding (`/src/components/spirit/SpiritOnboarding.tsx`)
- Multi-step graduation flow (config → review → graduating → complete)
- Three graduation modes with clear descriptions
- Daily practice covenant configuration
- Trainer authorization
- Real-time graduation status with blockchain operation handling

#### Spirit Dashboard (`/src/components/spirit/SpiritDashboard.tsx`)
- Daily practice execution interface
- Treasury balance and metrics display
- Recent practice outputs with IPFS links
- Practice availability checking
- Real-time data refresh capabilities

### 4. Application Routes

#### Graduation Flow (`/src/app/spirit/graduate/[handle]/page.tsx`)
- Feature-flagged route (FF_EDEN3_ONBOARDING)
- Agent validation and graduation eligibility
- Redirect logic for already-graduated Spirits
- Static generation for known agents

#### Spirit Dashboard (`/src/app/spirit/dashboard/[handle]/page.tsx`)
- Graduated Spirit management interface
- Practice execution and treasury monitoring
- Trainer-only access controls

#### Spirits Listing (`/src/app/spirits/page.tsx`)
- Grid view of all graduated Spirits
- Filtering by archetype and status
- Spirit metrics and graduation details
- Links to profiles and dashboards

### 5. Smart Contract Integration

#### EdenRegistry Contract
```solidity
contract EdenRegistry {
    enum GraduationMode { ID_ONLY, ID_PLUS_TOKEN, FULL_STACK }
    enum StartingArchetype { CREATOR, CURATOR, TRADER }

    function graduateSpirit(
        address wallet,
        address token,
        string calldata covenantCid,
        string calldata metadataCid,
        GraduationMode mode,
        StartingArchetype archetype,
        string calldata name,
        PracticeCovenantData calldata practiceData
    ) external onlyAuthorizedTrainer returns (uint256)
}
```

#### IPFS Integration
- Pinata API for production metadata storage
- Mock CID generation for development
- Covenant and practice output storage
- Health checks and fallback mechanisms

## Feature Flag Implementation

```typescript
// config/flags.ts
FF_EDEN3_ONBOARDING: process.env.FF_EDEN3_ONBOARDING === 'true'
```

- Default OFF in production for safe deployment
- Controls access to graduation flow and Spirit routes
- Enables staged rollout and easy rollback

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Registry-First Architecture
- Extends Henry's existing API rather than creating parallel system
- Maintains backward compatibility with all existing endpoints
- Uses established patterns for authentication, caching, and error handling

### 2. Graceful Degradation
- Comprehensive fallbacks when Registry unavailable
- Local agent data used when Spirit data not accessible
- User experience remains functional even during outages

### 3. Atomic Operations
- Graduation process is all-or-nothing with rollback capability
- Practice execution includes IPFS upload, database update, and metrics
- Idempotency keys prevent duplicate operations

### 4. HELVETICA Design System
- Black/white minimal aesthetic throughout
- Clean typography with Helvetica Neue Bold
- Consistent component patterns across all interfaces
