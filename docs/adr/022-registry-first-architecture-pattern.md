# ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED: ADR-022: Registry-First Architecture Pattern

This document has been **deprecated** and moved to the Registry documentation system.

## New Location
üìö **Current Documentation**: https://registry.eden.art/api/v1/docs/adr/ADR-022-registry-first-architecture-pattern

## Why This Changed
As part of ADR-001 (Documentation Consolidation), all Registry architectural documentation now lives in the Registry itself to maintain the Registry as the single source of truth.

## What You Should Do
1. **Update bookmarks** to point to the new Registry documentation API
2. **Use the Registry API** to access current documentation: `GET /api/v1/docs/adr/`
3. **Academy integration** will automatically fetch Registry docs via API

## Migration Date
2025-08-28
