# Eden Academy: Comprehensive Development Summary
*Week of August 15-22, 2025*

## 🎯 Executive Summary

We transformed Eden Academy from a basic infrastructure platform into a sophisticated AI-powered content pipeline designed for small creative teams. The pendulum swung from "bare-bones infra" back toward rich, textured experiences while maintaining focus on internal team tools rather than broad consumer features.

## 🏗️ What We Built This Week

### Core Infrastructure
1. **AI-Powered Content Pipeline**
   - **Upload** → **Auto-Tag** → **Inbox** → **Critique** → **Publish**
   - Claude Vision integration for automatic image analysis
   - Nina AI curator with Paris Photo standards
   - Budget controls and sampling rates

2. **Key Pages & Features**
   - `/upload` - Drag-and-drop image upload with agent/day selection
   - `/inbox` - Filtered content queue with bulk operations
   - `/critiques` - AI analysis results with verdicts and scores
   - `/admin/tagger` - System monitoring and backfill tools
   - Studio tabs on agent profiles for creator tools

3. **Database Enhancements**
   - Enhanced tagging schema with JSONB fields
   - Budget tracking tables
   - Date extraction functions
   - Proper indexing for filtering

### UI/UX Improvements
- 2x5 agent grid on homepage

## 📊 Key Decisions Made

### Strategic Pivots
1. **Team Tools Over Consumer Features**
   - Removed follow buttons and social mechanics
   - Focus on extended team workflows
   - Internal curation rather than public engagement

2. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - Nina calibrated to top 15-25% for INCLUDE
   - Paris Photo exhibition standards
   - Strict quality gates before publishing

3. **Unified Workflow**
   - Single pipeline for all agents
   - Consistent tagging schema
   - Shared critique standards

### Technical Choices
- Next.js 15.4 with App Router
- Supabase for database and auth
- Anthropic Claude for AI analysis
- Base64 image encoding for uploads
- Vercel for deployment

## 🔄 Current Workflow

```
1. UPLOAD → Images tagged with AI analysis
2. INBOX → Filter and select works
3. CRITIQUE → Nina evaluates against Paris Photo standards
4. PUBLISH → INCLUDE works go to collection
5. DISPLAY → Published works appear in Creations tab
```

## 📝 Final Notes

The system we built this week provides the foundation for both immediate needs (Solienne's Paris Photo preparation) and long-term vision (decentralized creator economy). By focusing on internal team tools first, we've created a robust pipeline that can scale to support multiple agents while maintaining quality standards.

The key is maintaining this balance: rich enough for meaningful creative practice, simple enough for daily use, flexible enough for different agent styles, and robust enough for commercial outcomes.

**Next Priority:** Implement the Practice Calendar and Product Categorization to give Solienne concrete tools for Paris Photo preparation while establishing patterns all agents can use.
