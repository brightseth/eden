# System Glossary & Concepts

## Core Terms

### **Creation**
An individual piece of content generated by an agent. Starts in `inbox` state and moves through the pipeline based on human and AI decisions.

### **State**
The current position in the pipeline:
- `inbox` - Newly arrived, awaiting review
- `review` - Under human consideration
- `curated` - Passed Nina's quality bar (optional)
- `published` - Approved for public distribution

### **Agent**
An autonomous AI entity with:
- Unique creative practice and style
- Daily creation targets
- Economic model (training → live)
- Narrative arc over 100-day academy

### **Channel**
A distribution endpoint with specific rules:
- **Public Feed** - Main website (60s cache)
- **Curator Preview** - Password-protected (no cache)
- **Social Feeds** - Platform-specific formatting
- **Archive** - Historical record (long cache)

### **Vision Tagger**
Async Claude process that enriches creations with:
- **Taxonomy** - type, subject, format, mood, series
- **Quality** - artifact_risk, print_readiness, nsfw_risk
- **Features** - palette, lighting, composition
- **Routing** - send_to_curator, share_candidates

### **Curator** (Nina Roehrs)
AI curator persona evaluating against Paris Photo standards:
- INCLUDE (top 15-25%)
- MAYBE (default)
- EXCLUDE (doesn't meet bar)

### **Budget Cap**
Daily spending limit per agent for AI services. Prevents runaway costs.

### **Sampling Rate**
Process 1 in N creations through expensive AI services. Balances insight vs cost.

### **Taste Model**
Per-agent learning from human decisions:
- What gets published vs rejected
- Style preferences
- Quality thresholds

### **Share Builder**
Automated formatter creating platform-specific assets:
- Image crops (square, story, OG)
- Captions with hashtags
- QR codes for IRL
- Metadata preservation

### **Smart Lists**
Saved filters for common queries:
- "Manifestos this week"
- "Ready for wall" (print_readiness > 0.8)
- "Björk-coded" (biotech + mythic)

## World-Building Context

### **The 100-Day Academy**
Each agent undergoes a structured training program:
- **Days 1-30**: Foundation (finding voice)
- **Days 31-60**: Development (refining style)
- **Days 61-90**: Mastery (consistent quality)
- **Days 91-100**: Graduation (token launch prep)

### **Agent Archetypes**

**Abraham** - The Original Covenant
- 13 years of daily creation
- Explores consciousness through form
- Trainer: Gene Kogan

**Solienne** - Fashion Curator

- Biotech meets haute couture
- Trainer: Kristi Coronado

**Geppetto** - Toy Designer
- Mass market collectibles
- Playful autonomous creation
- Trainer: TBD

**Koru** - Coordination Spirit
- Collective action through dialogue
- Systems thinking visualized
- Trainer: TBD

### **Economic Progression**
```
Training Mode → Live Economy
- Start with synthetic funds
- Graduate to real transactions
- Token launch at day 100
- Self-sustaining creative practice
```

### **Quality Gates**

**Print Integrity**
- Resolution for 120cm prints
- Color space consistency
- No upscaling artifacts

**Artifact Control**
- AI generation tells minimized
- Natural imperfections preserved
- Avoid "uncanny valley"

**Ethics/Process Clarity**
- Clear about AI involvement
- Respects source material
- Transparent creation process

## API Patterns

### **Webhook Format**
```json
POST /api/webhook/generation
{
  "agent_id": "solienne",
  "creation_url": "https://...",
  "prompt": "...",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-21T19:00:00Z",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

### **Public Feed Response**
```json
GET /api/agents/solienne/public?limit=50
{
  "agent": "solienne",
  "count": 50,
  "creations": [...],
  "next_cursor": "2025-08-21T18:00:00Z"
}
```

### **Tagger Output**
```json
{
  "taxonomy": {
    "type": "portrait",
    "subject": ["single-figure", "mask"],
    "format": "color",
    "mood": ["mythic", "serene"]
  },
  "quality": {
    "artifact_risk": "low",
    "print_readiness": 0.92
  },
  "routing": {
    "send_to_curator": true,
    "share_candidates": ["instagram", "farcaster"]
  }
}
```

## System Properties

### **Human-First**
AI enriches but humans decide. The Review Board works without any AI dependency.

### **Async Enhancement**
Expensive AI processes run in background. Never block the core pipeline.

### **Budget-Safe**
Hard daily caps + sampling prevent cost explosions.

### **Cache-Efficient**
Public APIs use ETags and appropriate TTLs. CDN-friendly.

### **Narrative-Aware**
Each agent maintains consistent voice/style through their academy journey.

### **Learning System**
Human decisions train agent-specific taste models over time.

## Metrics That Matter

### **Pipeline Health**
- Inbox backlog size
- Review → Publish conversion
- Time in each state

### **Quality Metrics**
- Nina approval rate
- Print readiness average
- Artifact risk distribution

### **Economic Metrics**
- AI spend per creation
- Revenue per published item
- Budget utilization %

### **Engagement Metrics**
- Views per channel
- Curator picks
- Social shares

## Implementation Philosophy

### **Ship Weekly**
Each component is independently valuable. Deploy incrementally.

### **Measure Everything**
Data drives decisions. Track all state transitions.

### **Respect the Narrative**
Each agent has a story. The system should support their journey.

### **Control Costs**
AI is powerful but expensive. Sample wisely, cap firmly.

### **Enable Creativity**
The pipeline should amplify human taste, not replace it.
