- [ ] Database connection pooling configured (minimum 20 connections)
- [ ] Redis instance for caching (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard access (Vercel Analytics, Sentry, or similar)
- [ ] Backup strategy implemented

### 2. Feature Flag Configuration
```env
# Master pipeline flag - Start with false, enable after validation
ENABLE_CREATIVE_PIPELINE=false

# Assessment system - Enable after pipeline is enabled
CREATIVE_PIPELINE_ASSESSMENT=false

# Economics validation - Enable after assessment is stable
CREATOR_AGENT_ECONOMICS=false

# Agent launching - Enable last, after full validation
CREATOR_AGENT_LAUNCH=false

# Full pipeline - Enable only after all components validated
CREATIVE_PIPELINE_FULL=false

# Monitoring configuration
PIPELINE_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
PIPELINE_PERFORMANCE_ALERTS=true
```

### 3. Database Migration Validation
```bash
# Run the migration in a staging environment first
psql -h your-supabase-db -f supabase/migrations/013_creative_pipeline_production.sql

# Verify tables were created
\dt creator_profiles assessment_scores pipeline_sessions agent_potential_mappings creator_economics

# Test RLS policies
SELECT * FROM creator_profiles; # Should return no rows for non-authenticated users
```

### 4. Performance Benchmarks
Before deployment, ensure your environment meets these requirements:
- API response time: <200ms p95
- Database query time: <100ms p95
- Pipeline completion rate: >95%
- Error rate: <1%

## Deployment Strategy: Gradual Rollout

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)
1. Deploy database migrations
2. Enable monitoring systems
3. Configure feature flags (all disabled)
4. Deploy code with feature flags off

### Phase 2: Internal Testing (Week 2)
```env
# Enable for internal testing only
ENABLE_CREATIVE_PIPELINE=true (for specific test users)
CREATIVE_PIPELINE_ASSESSMENT=true
```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] All pipeline stages complete successfully for test users
- [ ] Performance metrics within requirements
- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] Cultural messaging displays correctly

**Test Users:**

### Phase 3: Limited Beta (Week 3)
```env
# Expand to limited beta users
ENABLE_CREATIVE_PIPELINE=true
CREATIVE_PIPELINE_ASSESSMENT=true
CREATOR_AGENT_ECONOMICS=true
```

**Beta Criteria:**
- [ ] 25-50 selected creators
- [ ] Monitor completion rates >85%
- [ ] Cultural alignment scores trending upward
- [ ] No significant performance degradation

### Phase 4: Wider Beta (Week 4)
```env
# Enable for broader audience
ENABLE_CREATIVE_PIPELINE=true
CREATIVE_PIPELINE_ASSESSMENT=true
CREATOR_AGENT_ECONOMICS=true
CREATOR_AGENT_LAUNCH=false (still disabled)
```

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] 100-250 creators in pipeline
- [ ] Completion rate >80%
- [ ] Average cultural alignment >70%
- [ ] Performance within SLA requirements

### Phase 5: Production Rollout (Week 5+)
```env
# Full production rollout
ENABLE_CREATIVE_PIPELINE=true
CREATIVE_PIPELINE_ASSESSMENT=true
CREATOR_AGENT_ECONOMICS=true
CREATOR_AGENT_LAUNCH=true (if ready)
CREATIVE_PIPELINE_FULL=true (final enablement)
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Performance Metrics**
   - API response times by endpoint
   - Database query performance
   - Stage processing times
   - Overall pipeline completion times

2. **Business Metrics**
   - Creator onboarding conversion rates
   - Stage completion rates
   - Cultural alignment score distribution
   - Economic validation success rates

3. **Quality Metrics**
   - Error rates by stage
   - User satisfaction scores
   - Cultural feedback sentiment
   - Support ticket volume

### Alert Thresholds
```typescript
// Performance Alerts
API_RESPONSE_TIME_P95 > 300ms: Warning
API_RESPONSE_TIME_P95 > 500ms: Critical

// Business Alerts  
STAGE_COMPLETION_RATE < 70%: Warning
STAGE_COMPLETION_RATE < 50%: Critical

// Error Rate Alerts
ERROR_RATE > 2%: Warning
ERROR_RATE > 5%: Critical

// Cultural Alignment Alerts
CULTURAL_ALIGNMENT_AVERAGE < 60%: Warning
CULTURAL_ALIGNMENT_AVERAGE < 40%: Critical
```

### Dashboard Setup
1. **Pipeline Health Dashboard**
   - Total creators in pipeline
   - Stage distribution
   - Completion rates
   - Performance metrics

2. **Cultural Alignment Dashboard**
   - Average alignment scores by stage
   - Feedback sentiment analysis
   - Support interaction trends

3. **Economic Validation Dashboard**
   - Revenue projections
   - Model distribution
   - Validation success rates

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (Critical Issues)
```bash
# Emergency disable - set all flags to false
ENABLE_CREATIVE_PIPELINE=false
CREATIVE_PIPELINE_ASSESSMENT=false
CREATOR_AGENT_ECONOMICS=false
CREATOR_AGENT_LAUNCH=false
CREATIVE_PIPELINE_FULL=false

# Deploy flag changes immediately
vercel --prod
```

**Triggers for immediate rollback:**
- Error rate >10%
- Database performance degradation
- Critical security vulnerability
- User data corruption

### Gradual Rollback (Performance Issues)
1. Disable newest features first:
   ```env
   CREATIVE_PIPELINE_FULL=false
   CREATOR_AGENT_LAUNCH=false
   ```

2. Monitor for 30 minutes, if issues persist:
   ```env
   CREATOR_AGENT_ECONOMICS=false
   ```

3. If still problematic:
   ```env
   CREATIVE_PIPELINE_ASSESSMENT=false
   ```

4. Final fallback:
   ```env
   ENABLE_CREATIVE_PIPELINE=false
   ```

### Data Integrity During Rollback
- Creator profiles remain intact
- Completed assessments are preserved
- Pipeline sessions maintain state
- Economic data is retained

### Post-Rollback Procedures
1. Analyze logs and metrics to identify root cause
2. Communicate status to affected users
3. Implement fixes in staging environment
4. Re-test thoroughly before re-deployment
5. Document incident and lessons learned

## Database Management

### Backup Strategy
```bash
# Daily automated backups (recommended)
pg_dump -h your-supabase-db -U postgres eden_academy > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Pre-deployment backup
pg_dump -h your-supabase-db -U postgres eden_academy > backup_pre_pipeline_deployment.sql
```

### Migration Rollback
```sql
-- If migration needs to be rolled back, run:
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS creator_feature_flags;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pipeline_metrics;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS creator_economics;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS agent_potential_mappings;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pipeline_sessions;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS assessment_scores;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS creator_profiles;

-- Drop functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_creator_pipeline_status(UUID);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_creator_activity();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_updated_at_column();

-- Drop view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS creator_pipeline_overview;
```

### Performance Optimization
```sql
-- Monitor slow queries
SELECT query, mean_exec_time, calls 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query LIKE '%creator_profiles%' 
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC;

-- Add additional indexes if needed
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS creator_profiles_performance_idx 
ON creator_profiles(cultural_alignment, readiness_score, onboarding_stage);

-- Analyze query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM creator_pipeline_overview WHERE onboarding_stage = 'skill-assessment';
```

## Security Considerations

### Row Level Security Validation
```sql
-- Test RLS policies are working
SET ROLE authenticated;
SET request.jwt.claims ->> 'sub' = 'test-user-id';

-- Should only return rows for this user
SELECT * FROM creator_profiles;
SELECT * FROM assessment_scores;
```

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are sanitized
- File uploads (if implemented) are scanned
- Rate limiting is in place
- SQL injection protection verified

### Monitoring for Security Issues
```bash
# Monitor for unusual patterns
grep -i "injection\|xss\|malicious" /var/log/application.log

# Track authentication failures
grep -i "auth.*fail\|unauthorized" /var/log/application.log
```

## Performance Tuning

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Connection pooling configuration
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_connections = 200;
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements';

-- Query optimization
VACUUM ANALYZE creator_profiles;
VACUUM ANALYZE assessment_scores;
VACUUM ANALYZE pipeline_sessions;

-- Monitor table sizes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) as size
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY size DESC;
```

### Application Performance
```typescript
// Connection pooling in application
const supabaseConfig = {
  poolSize: 20,
  idleTimeout: 60000,
  acquireTimeout: 60000
};

// Implement caching for frequently accessed data
const cacheConfig = {
  ttl: 300, // 5 minutes
  maxSize: 1000
};
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**1. High Processing Times**
- Check database connection pool utilization
- Review slow query logs
- Verify feature flag evaluation performance

**2. Low Completion Rates**  
- Analyze stage-specific failure patterns
- Review cultural assessment thresholds
- Check user experience flow issues

**3. Cultural Alignment Issues**
- Review assessment scoring algorithms
- Validate cultural messaging tone
- Check community feedback patterns

### Debugging Steps
```bash
# Check application logs
tail -f /var/log/creative-pipeline.log

# Monitor database performance
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';

# Check feature flag service
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" https://api.yourapp.com/api/v1beta/creative-pipeline/health
```
