# MIYOMI Launch Readiness Checklist

## âœ… COMPLETED - Core Infrastructure

- [x] **Dashboard Buttons**: Fixed "Trigger Manual Drop", "Review Pending Picks", "Update Results"
- [x] **Claude SDK Integration**: Full implementation with pick generation and analysis
- [x] **API Routes**: Manual drop, pending picks, update results, status monitoring  
- [x] **Automated Scheduler**: 3x daily workflow (11:00, 15:00, 21:00 ET)
- [x] **Eden Integration**: Video generation and registry submission hooks
- [x] **Workflow Architecture**: Complete pick-to-deployment pipeline

## ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Critical)

### 1. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude SDK
- [ ] Configure `EDEN_API_KEY` and `EDEN_BASE_URL` for video generation
- [ ] Set `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` for secure API access
- [ ] Test environment with: `npx tsx scripts/start-miyomi-scheduler.ts test`

### 2. Market Data Integration
- [ ] **Kalshi API**: Set up account and API key for market data
- [ ] **Polymarket API**: Configure subgraph access for market resolution
- [ ] **Manifold API**: Add API key for market data and resolution checking
- [ ] Implement real market data fetching in `update-results/route.ts`

### 3. Database Schema 
- [ ] Create `miyomi_picks` table for pick storage and tracking
- [ ] Create `miyomi_performance` table for metrics and results
- [ ] Add database persistence to all API routes (currently using mock data)

### 4. Eden Video Generation
- [ ] Confirm Eden API endpoints for MIYOMI video generation
- [ ] Test video generation with sample pick and script
- [ ] Configure video hosting and CDN for generated content
- [ ] Implement video generation status polling

### 5. Curation Workflow
- [ ] Build review interface for pending picks (`/dashboard/miyomi/review`)
- [ ] Implement approval/rejection workflow with trainer feedback
- [ ] Add confidence thresholds for auto-approval
- [ ] Create pick revision system for improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ LAUNCH PHASE (7-14 days)

### Week 1: Alpha Testing
- [ ] Deploy scheduler to production environment
- [ ] Run 3-5 days of manual drops for testing
- [ ] Validate all API integrations and error handling
- [ ] Test fallback mechanisms and error recovery
- [ ] Verify performance metrics calculations

### Week 2: Beta Launch
- [ ] Enable automated scheduler for daily drops
- [ ] Monitor first week of automated performance
- [ ] Collect trainer feedback and iterate on pick quality
- [ ] Optimize confidence thresholds and curation rules
- [ ] Document performance benchmarks

## ðŸ“Š SUCCESS METRICS (30-day targets)

### Launch Gate Validation (Must Hit 3/3)
- [ ] **Demand Validation**: â‰¥$7,500 gross revenue in 7-day pilot
- [ ] **Retention Metrics**: â‰¥30% of first-week buyers return within 30 days  
- [ ] **Operational Efficiency**: â‰¥45 saleable outputs/month at â‰¤$500 compute cost

### Performance Targets
- [ ] Pick accuracy: â‰¥65% win rate
- [ ] Daily drop reliability: â‰¥95% successful automated drops
- [ ] Video generation: â‰¥90% successful video creation
- [ ] User engagement: â‰¥100 active subscribers within 30 days

## ðŸš¨ RISK MITIGATION

### Technical Risks
- [ ] **Claude API Rate Limits**: Implement request queuing and fallbacks
- [ ] **Market API Failures**: Add multiple data source redundancy  
- [ ] **Video Generation Delays**: Build 24-hour buffer for production
- [ ] **Database Performance**: Monitor query performance under load

### Quality Risks  
- [ ] **Pick Quality**: Implement trainer feedback loop and model improvement
- [ ] **Market Coverage**: Ensure diverse sector representation in picks
- [ ] **Accuracy Tracking**: Real-time performance monitoring and alerts
- [ ] **Content Moderation**: Automated screening for banned topics

### Business Risks
- [ ] **Revenue Generation**: Track subscription conversions and retention
- [ ] **Market Demand**: Monitor engagement metrics and user feedback
- [ ] **Competition**: Differentiate with contrarian expertise and NYC voice
- [ ] **Scalability**: Ensure infrastructure can handle growth

## ðŸ”— INTEGRATION DEPENDENCIES

### Eden Academy Dependencies
- [ ] Registry API for work submission
- [ ] Media generation pipeline for videos
- [ ] Token distribution system for rewards
- [ ] Analytics dashboard for performance tracking

### External API Dependencies  
- [ ] Anthropic Claude API (critical path)
- [ ] Kalshi/Polymarket/Manifold APIs (market data)
- [ ] Eden video generation service
- [ ] CDN for video hosting and delivery

## ðŸš€ LAUNCH COMMANDS

```bash
# Environment setup
cp .env.example .env.local
# Configure all required API keys

# Test the system
npx tsx scripts/start-miyomi-scheduler.ts test

# Start production scheduler  
npx tsx scripts/start-miyomi-scheduler.ts

# Monitor status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/miyomi/status

# Manual drop (for testing)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/miyomi/manual-drop \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id":"miyomi","trigger_time":"2025-08-27T12:00:00Z"}'
```

## ðŸ“ˆ GRADUATION CRITERIA

MIYOMI will be considered "graduated" and fully autonomous when:

1. **Technical Maturity**: 30 days of 95%+ automated drop success rate
2. **Financial Viability**: Consistent $5K+ monthly revenue with positive unit economics
3. **Quality Standards**: 70%+ pick accuracy rate sustained over 100 picks
4. **Community Growth**: 500+ active subscribers with 40%+ retention rate
5. **Operational Autonomy**: Trainer intervention required <5% of the time
