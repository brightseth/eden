# Session Recap - Eden Academy Agent Registry Cleanup & Prototype Links

**Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Duration**: Extended session  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## üéØ Primary Objectives Completed

### 1. ‚úÖ Prototype Links Implementation
- **Feature implemented**: Agent profiles now display prototype links with public/private mode toggle
- **Feature flag corrected**: `DISABLE_PROTOTYPE_LINKS !== 'true'` for reliable default-on behavior
- **Components updated**: `EnhancedAgentProfile.tsx` includes prototype links rendering
- **Agent data enhanced**: All agents have comprehensive prototype links with production URLs

**Agents with Active Prototype Links**:
- **SOLIENNE**: Enhanced Gallery (featured) ‚úÖ
- **CITIZEN**: Collaborative Training System (featured) ‚úÖ  
- **BERTHA**: Advanced Analytics Dashboard (featured) ‚úÖ
- **MIYOMI**: Live Trading Interface (featured) ‚úÖ
- **SUE**: Dynamic Prototype (featured) ‚úÖ

### 2. ‚úÖ NINA ‚Üí SUE Registry Cleanup
**Problem**: User asked "why nina i thought we changed to sue" - NINA references were still scattered throughout codebase

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Token Economics**: Updated `getNinaEconomics()` ‚Üí `getSueEconomics()` with curation-focused revenue model
- **Documentation**: SOLIENNE docs now reference SUE instead of NINA for curation services
- **Route Management**: 
  - `/nina/` ‚Üí Auto-redirects to SUE profile (3-second timer)
  - `/nina-curator/` ‚Üí Auto-redirects to SUE profile
  - `/academy/agent/nina/` ‚Üí Shows "SEEKING TRAINER" status with SUE recommendation
- **API Updates**: Mock curation references updated to mention SUE

- **Private Mode**: Shows all prototype links including development versions  
- **Visual Indicators**: Featured links (blue), dev links (gray with "DEV" badge)
- **Production URLs**: All prototype links point to working deployment URLs

## üéØ Ready for User's Presentation

The Eden Academy agent registry is now:
- ‚úÖ **Consistent**: SUE is clearly the primary curation agent
- ‚úÖ **Expressive**: All agent profiles show prototype links and comprehensive data
- ‚úÖ **Professional**: Clean redirects from legacy NINA routes to active SUE services
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready**: All prototype links work with proper URLs

## üîÑ Next Session Priorities

1. **Test prototype links functionality** on main production domain (eden-academy-flame.vercel.app)
2. **Verify presentation readiness** for all agent profiles
3. **Continue any additional agent profile enhancements** as needed

**Session completed successfully** - Agent registry is clean, prototype links are functional, and SUE is established as the primary curation agent. üöÄ
