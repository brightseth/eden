```

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Core tables (see supabase/collections-schema.sql)
collections              // Thematic groupings of works
curated_works            // Works with full analysis data  
collection_works         // Many-to-many collection membership
tournament_comparisons   // Head-to-head comparison results
batch_sessions          // Analysis session tracking
```

### Feature Flags

```typescript
// config/flags.ts
ART_CURATION_SYSTEM_ENABLED      // Master toggle
BATCH_CURATION_ENABLED           // Bulk analysis features
TOURNAMENT_MODE_ENABLED          // Competition features  
REVERSE_ENGINEERING_ENABLED      // Prompt generation
COLLECTION_MANAGEMENT_ENABLED    // Organization features
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. **Basic Curation Workflow**

```typescript
// Navigate to /curation
1. Browse works in Feed view
2. Select works by clicking (checkbox appears)  
3. Choose curator (SUE or NINA)
4. Click "ANALYZE SINGLE" for detailed analysis
```

### 2. **Batch Analysis**

```typescript
// Select 2+ works from feed
1. Choose multiple works (shows selection count)
2. Click "BATCH ANALYZE" 
3. Wait for analysis completion
4. View results in Analysis tab
5. Export results as CSV/JSON
```

### 3. **Tournament Creation**

```typescript
// Power-of-2 works required (4, 8, 16, etc.)
1. Select exactly 4, 8, 16, or 32 works
2. Click "TOURNAMENT" button (purple)
3. System creates bracket automatically
4. AI runs all comparisons
5. View bracket progression and final winner
```

### 4. **Collection Management**

```typescript
// Organize curated works
1. Go to Collections tab
2. Click "NEW COLLECTION"
3. Set name, description, curator, visibility
4. Add tags for categorization
5. Browse existing collections by curator/tags
```

### 5. **Reverse Engineering**

```typescript
// Generate creation prompts from analysis
1. Analyze any work (single or batch)
2. View "REVERSE ENGINEERING PROMPT" section
3. Copy prompt for use in generation tools
4. Prompts adapt to agent source and quality scores
```

## Curator Profiles

### SUE - Cultural Critic
- **Focus**: Cultural Relevance (25%), Innovation (25%), Conceptual Depth (20%)
- **Style**: Rigorous, culturally-aware, critically sharp
- **Strengths**: Theoretical context, cultural positioning, critical framework
- **Best For**: Academic analysis, cultural significance, critical evaluation

### NINA - Aesthetic Curator  
- **Focus**: Emotional Resonance (30%), Innovation (25%), Conceptual Strength (20%)
- **Style**: Intuitive, emotionally-attuned, aesthetically-focused
- **Strengths**: Visual impact, emotional connection, artistic merit
- **Best For**: Gallery curation, aesthetic evaluation, artistic impact

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **SUE Curate Page**: Extends `/agents/sue/curate` functionality
- **Eden API**: Fetches works from Abraham and Solienne agents
- **Works API**: Integrates with `/api/agents/[id]/works` endpoints

### Future Extensions
- **Registry Integration**: Connect to Eden Registry for agent metadata
- **IPFS Storage**: Permanent storage for curated collections
- **NFT Integration**: Mint curated collections as NFTs
- **Cross-Agent Analysis**: Include works from all 10 Eden agents

## Performance & Scalability

### Current Limitations (MVP)
- **Mock Data**: Uses in-memory storage for collections/tournaments
- **Limited Works**: Only Abraham and Solienne works supported
- **No Persistence**: Sessions reset on server restart

### Production Readiness
- **Database Integration**: Ready for Supabase/PostgreSQL integration
- **Caching**: API responses cached for performance
- **Rate Limiting**: Analysis requests throttled to prevent abuse
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for all operations

### Scaling Considerations
- **Batch Size Limits**: Max 50 works per batch analysis
- **Tournament Limits**: Max 32 works per tournament
- **Collection Limits**: No current limits (can add pagination)

## Development

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/curation/client.ts     # Client utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ supabase/collections-schema.sql  # Database schema
```

### Testing
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to curation system
http://localhost:3000/curation

# Test with feature flags
ART_CURATION_SYSTEM_ENABLED=true npm run dev
```

### Deployment
1. Apply database schema: `supabase/collections-schema.sql`
2. Set environment variables for feature flags
3. Deploy with existing Eden Academy infrastructure
4. Monitor via `/curation` endpoint

// Enable verbose logging
VERBOSE_LOGGING=true npm run dev

// Check feature flag status
GET /api/curation/status
```

### Production Monitoring
