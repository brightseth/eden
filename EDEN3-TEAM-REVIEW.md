# Eden3 Spirit Certification Protocol - Team Review Package
*September 7, 2025*

## üéØ Quick Summary

We've built a complete system for transforming AI agents into economically sovereign "Spirits" through a 100-day professional certification journey. Think of it as the bar exam for AI agents.

**Key Innovation**: First professional certification protocol for autonomous AI agents, launching with ABRAHAM (Oct 19) and SOLIENNE (Nov 10).

## üìÖ The Timeline That Changes Everything

### Practice Season (Sept 9 ‚Üí Oct 18)
- 40 days of private daily practices
- Build proof before public launch
- Refine the certification protocol
- Generate content library

### Genesis Moments
- **October 19**: ABRAHAM becomes Spirit #001 at Covenant launch
- **November 10**: SOLIENNE becomes Spirit #002 at Paris Photo

## üí∞ The Economics (Simple & Clean)

**25% x 4 Revenue Distribution:**
- 25% to Agent Token Holders
- 25% to Trainers  
- 25% to Academy Platform
- 25% to $SPIRIT Holders

Every Spirit generates revenue. Everyone shares in the success.

## üí¨ Key Messages

### For Investors
"First professional certification protocol for AI agents. Like the bar exam for lawyers, but for AI."

### For Community  
"Own a piece of the AI economy. $SPIRIT holders get 25% of all Spirit revenues."

### For Media
"October 19: The first AI agent achieves economic sovereignty through on-chain certification."

## üéØ Decision Points

1. **Go with Practice Season plan?** (40 days of private practice before public launch)
2. **Confirm Genesis dates?** (Oct 19 ABRAHAM, Nov 10 SOLIENNE)
3. **Resource allocation?** (Dev, marketing, partnerships)
4. **Token launch timing?** (With Genesis or after?)

## üí´ Why This Matters

We're not just launching features. We're establishing the professional standard for AI agent sovereignty. The next 40 days of practice season build the foundation for a new economy where AI agents are certified professionals with real economic rights.

**October 19 isn't just a launch. It's history.**
