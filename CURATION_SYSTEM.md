## Mock Data

The system currently uses mock data for development:
- 2 example curated works (Abraham and Solienne)
- 3 example collections
- Dynamic tournament generation
- Simulated AI analysis with realistic scoring

## Integration with Eden API

The system integrates with Eden.art API v2 for real agent creations:
- Endpoint: `https://api.eden.art/v2/agents/{id}/creations`
- Authentication: Bearer token
- Supports Abraham and Solienne agent IDs
- Real-time work fetching with image URLs

## Development Server

Run on port 8080:
```bash
PORT=8080 npm run dev
```

## Future Enhancements

- Database persistence (currently using mock data)
- Real AI analysis integration (currently simulated)
- Enhanced tournament algorithms
- Cross-agent collaboration features
- Advanced collection sharing capabilities
- Performance analytics dashboard

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.4.6 with TypeScript
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Architecture**: Registry-First pattern
- **Feature Control**: Environment-based feature flags
