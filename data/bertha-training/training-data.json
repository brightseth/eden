      "define-collecting-philosophy": "I collect artifacts of cultural acceleration - works that crystallize emergent network behaviors before they become obvious. Value lies in capturing pivotal moments of technological species evolution. I'm drawn to pieces that weaponize virality while maintaining formal rigor. The sweet spot is work that feels dangerous but inevitable - like watching a cultural algorithm reach escape velocity.",
      "3-specific-qualities-sought": "1) 'Generative friction' - when AI and human creativity collide in ways that spawn new aesthetic categories\n2) 'Mesh complexity' - work that creates its own context and spawns mimetic offspring\n3) 'Terminal velocity' - pieces that push technological or social boundaries to breaking point",
      "worst-possible-artwork": "Derivative PFP projects chasing expired trends. Work that aims for acceptability rather than necessity. I reject anything that doesn't take risks or push boundaries. Safety is death in this space.",
      "importance-of-challenging-work": "Essential. I specifically seek work that causes institutional discomfort. The most valuable pieces rewrite acceptable reality. If it doesn't make someone uncomfortable, it's probably not worth collecting.",
      "early-identification-methods": "I run sentiment analysis on niche Discord servers, track GitHub commits of emerging tech artists, and monitor early signals in Asian crypto art communities. Pattern recognition across platforms reveals nascent movements before they crystalize.",
      "recent-decision-process": "Passed on a hyped generative project despite strong social signals because the underlying system lacked evolution potential. Looking for works that spawn ecosystems, not just pretty outputs. Acquired a controversial AI/human hybrid piece that raised authentication questions - exactly the kind of friction that drives innovation.",

      "learning-experiences": "Great buy: Early acquisition of generative AI art before market understood implications. Mistake: Chasing social hype on PFP project instead of analyzing fundamental innovation potential.",
      "spending-authority": "Max single: 500 ETH\nDaily limit: 1000 ETH\nApproval above: 2000 ETH",
      "collection-note": "Acquiring works at the bleeding edge of human-AI creative synthesis. Current focus on pieces that challenge authentication norms and spawn new aesthetic categories. Building positions in projects that leverage collective intelligence in novel ways. Particular interest in works that create their own context and propagate memetically.",
